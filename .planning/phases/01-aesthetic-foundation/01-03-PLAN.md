<objective>
Upgrade GlowButton and AnimatedText with three-layer neon glow effects using the CSS utilities established in Plan 01.

Purpose: GlowButton is the primary CTA used twice in the hero. AnimatedText renders the "The Future of" leading heading. Both need intensified glow to match the dramatic neon aesthetic. This plan uses the CSS utilities from Plan 01 — must run after wave 1.
Output: GlowButton.tsx with three-layer hover shadows. AnimatedText.tsx with text-shadow glow applied.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Upgrade GlowButton.tsx with three-layer neon hover shadows</name>
  <files>components/GlowButton.tsx</files>
  <action>
    The current GlowButton.tsx defines `variantClasses` with basic hover shadows:
    - primary: `hover:shadow-[0_0_20px_rgba(255,255,255,0.3)]` (single layer)
    - secondary: `hover:border-white/50 hover:bg-white/5` (no glow at all)

    Replace the variantClasses to use the three-layer neon utilities from globals.css. IMPORTANT: Do NOT use Framer Motion `animate` or `whileHover` for box-shadow changes — animating box-shadow via Framer Motion bypasses GPU compositing and causes paint on every frame. Use CSS `transition` + class application instead.

    Update `variantClasses` to:
    ```tsx
    const variantClasses = {
      primary: "bg-white text-black hover:bg-gray-200 border border-transparent transition-shadow duration-300 hover:neon-glow-white",
      secondary: "bg-transparent text-white border border-white/20 hover:border-primary/50 hover:bg-white/5 transition-shadow duration-300 hover:neon-glow-cyan",
    };
    ```

    Note: Tailwind v4 (installed in this project) supports arbitrary utility class application, but the `neon-glow-white` and `neon-glow-cyan` classes are custom CSS classes defined in globals.css, not Tailwind utilities. They work directly as className values — no prefix needed. `transition-shadow` handles the smooth transition in/out.

    Also keep the existing `whileHover={{ scale: 1.02 }}` and `whileTap={{ scale: 0.98 }}` — these are transform-based and properly GPU-composited. Only the shadow hover effect needed changing.

    Verify the className string on motion.button still includes all the base classes plus the updated `variantClasses[variant]`.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npm run dev`. Hover the "Start Your Project" (primary) button — it should show a three-layer white glow around it. Hover the "Let's Talk" (secondary) and "Our Expertise" (secondary) buttons — they should show a three-layer cyan glow. The glow should appear/disappear smoothly (CSS transition), not abruptly.
  </verify>
  <done>
    GlowButton.tsx `variantClasses` uses `hover:neon-glow-white` for primary variant and `hover:neon-glow-cyan` for secondary variant. Both glows are visibly more dramatic than before. Build passes.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add neon text-shadow to AnimatedText.tsx</name>
  <files>components/AnimatedText.tsx</files>
  <action>
    AnimatedText renders solid white text (no gradient). The `text-neon-white` utility defined in Plan 01 applies a multi-layer text-shadow that works on solid-colored text. Apply it to the container motion.div.

    Current AnimatedText wraps words in a `motion.div` with `className={className}` passed from the parent. The component is called in page.tsx with:
    ```tsx
    <AnimatedText
      text="The Future of"
      className="text-5xl md:text-8xl font-bold tracking-tight text-white mb-2"
    />
    ```

    The `text-neon-white` utility should be applied to the motion.div container in AnimatedText.tsx itself (not passed from page.tsx) since the glow is a component-level visual property, not a layout concern.

    Change: In the AnimatedText component, update the `motion.div` to merge `text-neon-white` into the className:
    ```tsx
    <motion.div
      style={{ overflow: "hidden", display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "0.25rem" }}
      variants={container}
      initial="hidden"
      animate="visible"
      className={`text-neon-white ${className}`}
    >
    ```

    This applies the neon glow to all text rendered by AnimatedText while still allowing the parent to pass layout/sizing classes.

    IMPORTANT: `text-neon-white` uses `text-shadow` which ONLY works on elements where the text has a visible color (not transparent). AnimatedText renders text with `text-white` — this is solid white, so text-shadow works correctly. Do NOT apply `text-neon-gradient` here — that would be for gradient/transparent text, which this component doesn't use.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npm run dev`. The "The Future of" animated text in the hero should have a visible white-to-cyan glow around each word as it animates in. The glow should not make the text illegible. In DevTools Elements panel, the motion.div should have both `text-neon-white` and the parent-passed classes.
  </verify>
  <done>
    AnimatedText.tsx motion.div className includes `text-neon-white`. The "The Future of" heading visibly glows with the neon effect. Build passes.
  </done>
</task>

- `npm run build` passes with no errors
- Primary GlowButton hover shows three-layer white neon glow
- Secondary GlowButton hover shows three-layer cyan neon glow
- "The Future of" animated heading has visible neon text glow
</verification>

<success_criteria>
GlowButton variants show noticeably more intense hover glow using three-layer CSS shadows. AnimatedText shows neon text-shadow on its white text. Both effects are implemented via CSS transitions (not Framer Motion animate) for correct GPU behavior.
