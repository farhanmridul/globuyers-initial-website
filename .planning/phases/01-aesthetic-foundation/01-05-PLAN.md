<objective>
Human visual verification of all Phase 1 aesthetic changes working together in the browser.

Purpose: Individual code changes can pass builds and unit checks but still look wrong when combined — misaligned glows, illegible text, broken spotlight tracking, animations not pausing. A human must confirm the end state matches the phase goal: "the existing site looks dramatically more intense and polished."
Output: Approved visual state or itemized issues for gap closure.

  <name>Visual verification of all Phase 1 changes</name>
  <action>Run `npm run dev`, open http://localhost:3000, and verify each Phase 1 requirement in the browser per the how-to-verify checklist below.</action>
  <what-built>
    All Phase 1 aesthetic changes:
    - Three-layer neon glow on buttons and service card borders (AES-01)
    - Neon text-shadow on headings and gradient text (AES-02)
    - SpotlightCard cursor tracking on service cards (AES-03)
    - MotionConfig reduced-motion wrapper in layout (AES-04)
    - FloatingParticles and GradientOrb pause when off-screen (AES-05)
    - Capability bullets on all 4 service cards (SERV-01)
    - Footer Privacy link routes to /privacy-policy (FOOT-01)
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    Run `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:3000. Check each item:

    1. **Button glow (AES-01):** Hover "Start Your Project" (primary) — should see a bright three-layer white glow. Hover "Let's Talk" and "Our Expertise" (secondary) — should see cyan three-layer glow. Both should be noticeably more dramatic than a single-layer shadow.

    2. **Heading glow (AES-02):** The "Digital Commerce" gradient text in the hero should have a visible cyan drop-shadow glow. "Command Center" and "Ready to Upgrade?" solid headings should have a neon text-shadow.

    3. **SpotlightCard (AES-03):** Hover over each service card and move cursor slowly across it — a bright spotlight circle should visibly follow the cursor, making the card feel physically illuminated from the cursor position. The spotlight should disappear when cursor leaves the card.

    4. **Reduced motion (AES-04):** In Chrome DevTools -> Rendering -> "Emulate CSS media feature prefers-reduced-motion" -> set to "reduce". Refresh the page. All motion (particles, orbs, scroll animations) should stop. Text still appears but doesn't animate in.

    5. **Off-screen pause (AES-05):** Scroll down past the hero so FloatingParticles are fully off screen. Scroll back up — particles resume. Scroll to bottom — contact section GradientOrb should be pulsing; scroll away and it pauses.

    6. **Service card bullets (SERV-01):** Scroll to the Services section. Each card should show 2-4 bullet points below the description text, prefixed with ">" in cyan.

    7. **Privacy link (FOOT-01):** Scroll to footer. Click "Privacy" — should navigate to the privacy policy page at /privacy-policy (not stay on the home page or show a 404).

    Overall impression: Does the site look dramatically more intense and polished?
