<objective>
Add three-layer neon CSS utility classes and wire up MotionConfig for global reduced-motion accessibility.

Purpose: These are the shared foundations other plans build on. CSS utilities give component upgrades a consistent vocabulary. MotionConfig at the root means every downstream Framer Motion component respects OS accessibility settings automatically — no per-component work.
Output: Updated globals.css with neon utilities, new Providers.tsx, updated layout.tsx.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add neon CSS utility classes to globals.css</name>
  <files>app/globals.css</files>
  <action>
    The existing `globals.css` has `.glow-cyan` and `.glow-purple` with two-layer box-shadows, and `.text-glow` with a two-layer text-shadow. Upgrade these in-place AND add new utilities:

    1. Replace `.glow-cyan` (two-layer) with `.neon-glow-cyan` (three-layer):
    ```css
    .neon-glow-cyan {
      box-shadow:
        0 0 5px rgba(14, 165, 233, 0.9),
        0 0 20px rgba(14, 165, 233, 0.55),
        0 0 45px rgba(14, 165, 233, 0.25);
    }
    ```

    2. Replace `.glow-purple` with `.neon-glow-purple` (three-layer):
    ```css
    .neon-glow-purple {
      box-shadow:
        0 0 5px rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.9),
        0 0 20px rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.55),
        0 0 45px rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.25);
    }
    ```

    3. Add `.neon-glow-white` for white button primary variant:
    ```css
    .neon-glow-white {
      box-shadow:
        0 0 5px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9),
        0 0 20px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5),
        0 0 40px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
    }
    ```

    4. Add `.text-neon-white` for solid white headings:
    ```css
    .text-neon-white {
      text-shadow:
        0 0 8px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9),
        0 0 16px rgba(14, 165, 233, 0.6),
        0 0 32px rgba(14, 165, 233, 0.3);
    }
    ```

    5. Add `.text-neon-gradient` for gradient (transparent) text — MUST use filter not text-shadow, because text-shadow is invisible on `bg-clip-text text-transparent` elements:
    ```css
    .text-neon-gradient {
      filter:
        drop-shadow(0 0 8px rgba(14, 165, 233, 0.8))
        drop-shadow(0 0 20px rgba(14, 165, 233, 0.4));
    }
    ```

    Keep the old `.text-glow` class (leave it, don't delete — may be referenced elsewhere). Append the new classes at the end of the "Glow effect utilities" section.

    IMPORTANT: Do NOT use CSS `transition` on box-shadow within these utility classes. The box-shadow transitions for hover states belong in the component files using `transition-shadow` Tailwind utilities. These are static utility definitions only.

    Run `npm run build` — must complete with no TypeScript or CSS errors.
    Open browser DevTools and search globals.css output for `neon-glow-cyan` — must appear with three comma-separated shadow values.
  </verify>
  <done>
    `app/globals.css` contains `.neon-glow-cyan`, `.neon-glow-purple`, `.neon-glow-white`, `.text-neon-white`, and `.text-neon-gradient` as distinct classes. Build passes.

  <name>Task 2: Create Providers.tsx and wire MotionConfig into layout.tsx</name>
  <files>components/Providers.tsx, app/layout.tsx</files>
  <action>
    `app/layout.tsx` is a Server Component. `MotionConfig` from framer-motion is a Client Component (uses hooks internally). Importing it directly into layout.tsx will cause a Next.js build error. Use the thin Providers pattern instead.

    Step 1 — Create `components/Providers.tsx`:
    ```tsx
    "use client";
    import { MotionConfig } from "framer-motion";
    import { ReactNode } from "react";

    export function Providers({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
      return <MotionConfig reducedMotion="user">{children}</MotionConfig>;
    }
    ```

    `reducedMotion="user"` reads the OS `prefers-reduced-motion` media query. When the user has reduced motion enabled in their OS, all downstream `motion.*` transform/layout animations will be suppressed automatically. Opacity and color transitions are preserved.

    Step 2 — Update `app/layout.tsx` to import and use Providers:
    - Add `import { Providers } from "@/components/Providers";`
    - Wrap `{children}` inside `<Providers>...</Providers>` within the `<body>` tag
    - Layout stays as Server Component (no "use client" directive needed)

    The resulting layout body:
    ```tsx
    <body className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}>
      <Providers>{children}</Providers>
    </body>
    ```

    Do NOT add "use client" to layout.tsx itself — the Providers component handles the client boundary.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npm run build` — must complete with no errors.
    Run `npm run dev` and open the site. In Chrome DevTools, open Rendering tab, enable "Emulate CSS media feature prefers-reduced-motion: reduce". Verify that the FloatingParticles are still visible (opacity transitions remain) but the floating y-animation motion stops. The scroll-triggered animations (whileInView) should also stop.
  </verify>
  <done>
    `components/Providers.tsx` exists with "use client" + MotionConfig. `app/layout.tsx` imports Providers and wraps children with it. Build passes. With OS reduce-motion emulated, Framer Motion animations cease site-wide.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npm run build` completes with zero errors
- `app/globals.css` contains all 5 new utility classes (neon-glow-cyan, neon-glow-purple, neon-glow-white, text-neon-white, text-neon-gradient)
- `components/Providers.tsx` exists with "use client" and MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"
- `app/layout.tsx` wraps children in Providers component
</verification>

<success_criteria>
CSS utility classes exist and are syntactically valid. MotionConfig is active at the root layout. Build passes.
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-aesthetic-foundation/01-01-SUMMARY.md`
