<objective>

  <name>Visual verification of all Phase 2 sections</name>
  <action>Run `npm run dev`, open http://localhost:3000, scroll the full page, and verify each Phase 2 requirement in the browser per the how-to-verify checklist below.</action>
  <what-built>
Three new marketing sections built and wired into the landing page:

1. **How We Work** — 4-step horizontal process timeline (Discovery → Build → Launch → Support), desktop row layout with ──▶ connectors, stagger animation on scroll
2. **Tech Stack** — Badge grid in 3 categories (Frontend / Ecommerce / Analytics) with real react-icons brand icons and neon hover glow
3. **Why GloBuyers** — 3 differentiator cards (Shopify Specialists, Fast Predictable Delivery, Post-Launch Support) with Feather icon accents

All three animate in with staggered scroll-triggered reveals. Page order: Hero → Services → Stats → How We Work → Tech Stack → Why GloBuyers → Contact.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Run the dev server if not already running:
```bash
cd /Users/Farhan/Documents/Personal/GloBuyers/Website && npm run dev
```
Visit http://localhost:3000

**Check each section:**

1. **How We Work section (PROC-01, PROC-02, PROC-03)**
   - Scroll past the Stats section — the "How We Work" section appears
   - 4 numbered steps visible: 01 Discovery, 02 Build, 03 Launch, 04 Support
   - Each step shows a large faded number, bold title, and a 1–2 sentence deliverable description
   - Desktop: steps in a horizontal row with ──▶ arrows between them
   - Refresh and slowly scroll into view — steps animate in one by one (stagger fade-up)
   - Hover a step card — subtle neon cyan border glow

2. **Tech Stack section (TECH-01, TECH-02, TECH-03)**
   - Scroll past How We Work — "Our Stack" section with subtle background tint
   - Three category labels: Frontend, Ecommerce, Analytics
   - Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (5 badges)
   - Ecommerce: Shopify, Stripe (2 badges)
   - Analytics: Google Analytics (1 badge)
   - Each badge shows a recognizable brand icon on the left and the tech name on the right (no broken icons / squares)
   - Hover a badge — neon cyan glow
   - Badges animate in with stagger when section enters viewport

3. **Why GloBuyers section (DIFF-01, DIFF-02, DIFF-03)**
   - Scroll past Tech Stack — 3 cards visible in a row
   - Card 1: shopping bag icon, "Shopify Specialists" headline, Shopify expertise copy
   - Card 2: lightning bolt icon, "Fast, Predictable Delivery" headline, delivery timeline copy
   - Card 3: life ring icon, "Post-Launch Support" headline, 30-day support copy
   - Cards animate in with stagger on scroll
   - Hover a card — neon cyan border glow

4. **Overall page check**
   - Browser console — no red errors
   - Full scroll: Hero → Services → Stats → How We Work → Tech Stack → Why GloBuyers → Contact → Footer
   - No layout overlap, broken text, or missing sections
   - Existing sections unchanged

5. **Mobile check (resize browser to ~375px width)**
   - How We Work: steps stack vertically, no horizontal arrows
   - Tech Stack: badges wrap naturally
   - Why GloBuyers: cards stack vertically
