## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Single page only — all content in app/page.tsx, no new routes
- [Init]: Dark + neon glow aesthetic — push existing direction further, not replace it
- [Research]: Accessibility before content — MotionConfig + useInView pause must be Phase 1, not retrofitted
- [Research]: SpotlightCard pattern uses useMotionValue + useMotionTemplate (not animated boxShadow — performance pitfall)
- [Research]: Math.random() in render body causes Next.js 16 hydration hard errors — must live in useEffect

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: SVG logo assets for TechStackSection must be sourced before that section can be built — confirm license terms per logo
- [Phase 2]: Process step copy (deliverable descriptions, time estimates) needs validation against actual GloBuyers service delivery
